> This software is **Emerging** and subject to ECMWF's guidelines on [Software Maturity](https://github.com/ecmwf/codex/raw/refs/heads/main/Project%20Maturity).

**earthkit-hydro** is a Python library for common hydrological functions. It is the hydrological component of [earthkit](https://github.com/ecmwf/earthkit).

## Main Features

- Support for PCRaster, CaMa-Flood and HydroSHEDS river networks
- Computing statistics over catchments and subcatchments
- Finding catchments and subcatchments
- Calculating distances along river networks
- Calculation of upstream or downstream fields
- Handle arbitrary missing values
- Handle N-dimensional fields

## Installation
For a default installation, run

```
pip install earthkit-hydro
```

For a developer installation (includes linting and test libraries), run

```
git clone https://github.com/ecmwf/earthkit-hydro.git
cd earthkit-hydro
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```

## Documentation
**An [example notebook](docs/notebooks/example.ipynb) showing how to use the earthkit-hydro is provided in addition to the documentation below.**

earthkit-hydro can be imported as following:
```
import earthkit.hydro as ekh
```

The package contains different ways of constructing or loading a `RiverNetwork` object. A `RiverNetwork` object is a representation of a river network on a grid.
It can be used to compute basic hydrological functions, such as propagating a scalar field along the river network or extracting a catchment from the river network.

### Mathematical Details
Given a discretisation of a domain i.e. a set of points $\mathcal{D}=\{ (x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, a river network is a directed acyclic graph $\mathcal{R}=(V,E)$ where the vertices $V \subseteq \mathcal{D}$. The out-degree of each vertex is at most 1 i.e. each point in the river network points to at most one downstream location.

For ease of notation, if an edge exists from $(x_i, y_i)$ to $(x_j, y_j)$, we write $i \rightarrow j$.

### Readers

```
ekh.river_network.load(domain, version)
```

### Computing Metrics Over River Networks
There are four high-level ways to compute metrics depending on the use-case.

#### Metrics Over Upstream Nodes
```
ekh.upstream.sum(river_network, field, weights=None)
ekh.upstream.max(river_network, field, weights=None)
ekh.upstream.min(river_network, field, weights=None)
ekh.upstream.mean(river_network, field, weights=None)
ekh.upstream.prod(river_network, field, weights=None)
ekh.upstream.std(river_network, field, weights=None)
ekh.upstream.var(river_network, field, weights=None)
```
Given an input field, returns as output a new field with the upstream metric calculated for each cell.

#### Metrics Over Downstream Nodes
```
ekh.downstream.sum(river_network, field, weights=None)
ekh.downstream.max(river_network, field, weights=None)
ekh.downstream.min(river_network, field, weights=None)
ekh.downstream.mean(river_network, field, weights=None)
ekh.downstream.prod(river_network, field, weights=None)
ekh.downstream.std(river_network, field, weights=None)
ekh.downstream.var(river_network, field, weights=None)
```
Given an input field, returns as output a new field with the downstream metric calculated for each cell.

#### Metrics Over Catchments
```
ekh.catchments.sum(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
ekh.catchments.max(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
ekh.catchments.min(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
ekh.catchments.mean(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
ekh.catchments.prod(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
ekh.catchments.std(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
ekh.catchments.var(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
```
Given a field and a series of points, calculates the metric over all upstream nodes for each of the points.

#### Metrics Over Subcatchments
```
ekh.subcatchments.sum(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
ekh.subcatchments.max(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
ekh.subcatchments.min(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
ekh.subcatchments.mean(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
ekh.subcatchments.prod(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
ekh.subcatchments.std(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
ekh.subcatchments.var(river_network, field, points, weights=None)
```
Given a field and a series of points, finds the subcatchments defined by the points and computes the metric for each subcatchment.

#### Metrics Over Arbitrary Zones
```
ekh.zonal.sum(field, labels, weights=None, return_field=False)
ekh.zonal.max(field, labels, weights=None, return_field=False)
ekh.zonal.min(field, labels, weights=None, return_field=False)
ekh.zonal.mean(field, labels, weights=None, return_field=False)
ekh.zonal.prod(field, labels, weights=None, return_field=False)
ekh.zonal.std(field, labels, weights=None, return_field=False)
ekh.zonal.var(field, labels, weights=None, return_field=False)
```
Calculates a metric over the input field for each zone defined by the labels field. If return_field is True, returns a field otherwise returns a dictionary of {label: metric} pairs.

_(for advanced users)_
Similarly, one can also use a low-level API via
```
ekh.calculate_upstream_metric(river_network, field, metric, weights=None)
ekh.calculate_catchment_metric(river_network, field, points, metric, weights=None)
ekh.calculate_subcatchment_metric(river_network, field, points, metric, weights=None)
ekh.calculate_zonal_metric(field, labels, metric, weights=None)

# applies the ufunc on the field starting from the sources all the way down to the sinks
ekh.flow_downstream(river_network, field, ufunc=np.add)
# applies the ufunc on the field starting from the sinks all the way up to the sources
ekh.flow_upstream(river_network, field, ufunc=np.add)
```
These are analagous to above.

### Finding Catchments and Subcatchments

```
ekh.catchments.find(river_network, field)
```
Finds the catchments (all upstream nodes of specified nodes, with overwriting).\
$$v_i^{\prime} = v_j^{\prime}  ~ \text{if} ~  v_j^{\prime} \neq 0 ~ \text{else} ~ v_i, ~j ~ \text{s.t.} ~ i \rightarrow j$$

<img src="docs/images/catchment.gif" width="200px" height="160px" />

```
ekh.subcatchments.find(river_network, field)
```
Finds the subcatchments (all upstream nodes of specified nodes, without overwriting).\
$$v_i^{\prime} = v_j^{\prime}  ~ \text{if} ~  (v_j^{\prime} \neq 0 ~ \text{and} ~ v_j = 0) ~ \text{else} ~ v_i, ~j ~ \text{s.t.} ~ i \rightarrow j$$

<img src="docs/images/subcatchment.gif" width="200px" height="160px" />

### Calculating Distances or Lengths

```
ekh.distance.min(river_network, points, weights=None, upstream=False, downstream=True)
ekh.distance.max(river_network, points, weights=None, upstream=False, downstream=True)
```
Given a set of input points, computes the min or max distance (upstream and/or downstream depending on input) from those points for all cells in the field. Unreachable points are given a value np.inf. Weights represents the distance to a downstream cell (weights at sinks are ignored). By default, it is assumed the distance to any downstream cell is 1 regardless if the connection is diagonal or not.

```
ekh.length.min(river_network, points, weights=None, upstream=False, downstream=True)
ekh.length.max(river_network, points, weights=None, upstream=False, downstream=True)
```
Given a set of input points, computes the min or max length (upstream and/or downstream depending on input) of the network starting from those points for all cells in the field. Unreachable points are given a value np.inf. Weights represents the length of the river in the grid cell. By default, this is assumed to be one.

We also provide some analagous convenience functions for calculating shortest/longest distances/lengths to sources or sinks.
```
ekh.distance.to_source(river_network, weights, path='shortest')
ekh.distance.to_sink(river_network, weights, path='shortest')

ekh.length.to_source(river_network, weights, path='shortest')
ekh.length.to_sink(river_network, weights, path='shortest')
```

### Calculating Upstream or Downstream Fields

```
ekh.move_downstream(river_network, field, ufunc=np.add)
```
Updates each node with the sum of its upstream nodes.\
$$v_i^{\prime}=\sum_{j \rightarrow i}~v_j$$

```
ekh.move_upstream(river_network, field)
```
Updates each node with its downstream node.\
$$v_i^{\prime} = v_j, ~j ~ \text{s.t.} ~ i \rightarrow j$$

### Exporting or Masking a River Network

```
river_network.create_subnetwork(field)
```
Computes the river subnetwork defined by a field mask of the domain.

```
river_network.export(filename)
```
Exports the `RiverNetwork` as a joblib pickle.

## Migrating from PCRaster

earthkit-hydro provides many functions with PCRaster equivalents, summarised below:

| PCRaster | earthkit-hydro |  Note |
|---|---|---|
| accuflux | upstream.sum | |
| catchmenttotal | upstream.sum |  |
| areatotal | zonal.sum | return_field=True |
| areaaverage | zonal.mean | return_field=True |
| areamaximum | zonal.max | return_field=True |
| areaminimum | zonal.min | return_field=True |
| downstream | move_upstream | |
| upstream | move_downstream | |
| catchment | catchments.find | |
| subcatchment | subcatchments.find | |
| path | upstream.max | |
| ldddist | distance.min | friction input is slightly different to weights, and by default ekh takes distance between two nodes to be one regardless if on diagonal or not |
| downstreamdist | distance.to_sink | Same caveats as for ldddist |
| slopelength | distance.to_source | path="longest", same caveats as for ldddist |
| abs, sin, cos, tan, ...  | np.abs, np.sin, np.cos, np.tan, ... | any numpy operations can be directly used |

_Points of difference_
- earthkit-hydro treats missing values as np.nans i.e. any arithmetic involving a missing value will return a missing value. PCRaster does not always handle missing values exactly the same.
- earthkit-hydro can handle vector fields and fields of integers, floats, bools. PCRaster supports a restricted subset of this.
